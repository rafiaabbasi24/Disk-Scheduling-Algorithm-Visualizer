# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm-Visualizer

# Overview

This project aims to provide an intuitive and interactive web-based visualizer to help users comprehend disk scheduling algorithms in a practical manner. By allowing real-time visualization of disk movements, this tool will serve as an educational aid for students, researchers, and developers. Users will be able to input disk request sequences, choose between different scheduling techniques, and observe the impact on seek time and disk head movement.

# Features

Implement interactive animations using HTML5 Canvas, enabling users to visualize the movement of disk heads in response to different request sequences. • Integrate Plotly for data visualization, allowing real-time graphical representations of scheduling performance, including seek time comparisons and movement efficiency. • Include comprehensive educational content, explaining the need for disk scheduling, various algorithm types, and real-world applications.
