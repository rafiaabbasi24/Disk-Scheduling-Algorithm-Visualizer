# Disk-Scheduler-Visualizer

This website is an interactive disk scheduling visualizer designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, with a comprehensive home page containing information about disk scheduling and its description. The website is equipped with a button that leads to a separate webpage showcasing in-depth information about Disk Scheduling, its importance, and some critical terms associated with it. The home page also features a navigation bar containing links to 6 different disk scheduling algorithms:

1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
3. SCAN (Elevator Scheduling Algorithm)
4. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
5. LOOK
6. C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)

Furthermore, each algorithm is displayed in its own card module, with two respective buttons for further information about the algorithm and to visualize it. The Home Page has card modules for every Disk Scheduling algorithm. Within each card module, there are two respective buttons for

a) More information about thr algorithm

When the information button is clicked, it takes the user to a web page containing more detailed information about the specific algorithm. It showcases the algorithm's advantages, disadvantages, and an example with an initial sequence, head position, and disk position (if applicable). The algorithm example is then visualized using Canvas.js, displaying a graph representing the Disk Number vs. Request Sequence on the Y and X-axis, respectively.

b) Visualize
The website also offers a 'Visualize' button for each algorithm. When clicked, it leads the user to a webpage where they can input data related to the algorithm, and in real-time, the output is visualized using Canvas JS. The graph represents the Disk Number vs. Request Sequence on the Y and X-axis, respectively, along with the seek time and sequence of operations. These features make the website a comprehensive tool for understanding and learning about disk scheduling algorithms.

The project also contains C++ Module that has algorithms implemented in C++ language. To display the output and other information using C++, the user can simply download the C++ file, compile and run it to obtain the outputs
